# Justin Mauldin's Rails Assessment:
My Rails API implementation successfully accomplishes the requirements set forth in the [HopSkipDrive Rails Assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FhyO5fxFIzCF6RIDDnfh4zwls7x974dI8pHB4AUg2Kc/edit?usp=sharing) instructions provided to me.

## API Endpoints
Below is a comprehensive list of all the API endpoints that are created & exposed by this Rails API app.

* ### Get All Rides for a Specific Driver:
  There are two ways you can go about returning ride records for a specific driver.  

  First, is to return all rides:  
  ```
  GET /api/v1/drivers/1/rides

  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "start_address": "12200 E Mississippi Ave, Aurora, CO 80012",
      "end_address": "1550 S Potomac St, Aurora, CO 80012",
      "created_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:19.550Z",
      "updated_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:19.686Z",
      "driver_id": 1,
      "score": 100.74
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "start_address": "12200 E Mississippi Ave, Aurora, CO 80012",
      "end_address": "200 S Ironton St, Aurora, CO 80012",
      "created_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:19.688Z",
      "updated_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:19.910Z",
      "driver_id": 1,
      "score": 84.34
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "start_address": "12051 E Arizona Ave. Aurora, CO 80012",
      "end_address": "8580 E Lowry Blvd, Denver, CO 80230",
      "created_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:20.181Z",
      "updated_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:20.388Z",
      "driver_id": 1,
      "score": 65.38
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "start_address": "12200 E Mississippi Ave, Aurora, CO 80012",
      "end_address": "8580 E Lowry Blvd, Denver, CO 80230",
      "created_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:19.912Z",
      "updated_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:20.179Z",
      "driver_id": 1,
      "score": 53.74
    }
  ]
  ```

  The second is to pass in `per_page` & `per_page` params & return a paginated list of ride records:
  ``` 
  GET /api/v1/drivers/1/rides?per_page=2&page=2

  [
    {
      "id": 4,
      "start_address": "12051 E Arizona Ave. Aurora, CO 80012",
      "end_address": "8580 E Lowry Blvd, Denver, CO 80230",
      "created_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:20.181Z",
      "updated_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:20.388Z",
      "driver_id": 1,
      "score": 65.38
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "start_address": "12200 E Mississippi Ave, Aurora, CO 80012",
      "end_address": "8580 E Lowry Blvd, Denver, CO 80230",
      "created_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:19.912Z",
      "updated_at": "2023-12-30T03:36:20.179Z",
      "driver_id": 1,
      "score": 53.74
    }
  ]
  ```
 
## Testing
This app was developed using TDD via Rspec tests.  The app is fully tested with all tests passing.

Model tests were created using RSpec & Shoulda Matchers, with HTTP requests being made in tests utilizing VCR & WebMock to record requests & limit API calls.

* ### Running the Full Test Suite:

  From the root of the directory, type the below command to run the full test suite:

  ```
  $ rspec
  ```

* ### Running a Single Test File:

  Type this command from the root of the directory.

  ```
  $ rspec ./spec/requests/api/v1/rides_request_spec.rb

  ```
* ### Running a Single Test From a Single Test File:

  Type this command from the root of the directory.

  *(Just change the line number in the command to run a different test in that file.)*

  ```
  $ rspec ./spec/requests/api/v1/rides_request_spec.rb:25
  ```

# HopSkipDrive Rails Assessment Prompt:

Unlike many other rideshares, HopSkipDrive is a scheduled ride service and not an on-demand ride service. In our app for drivers, we show them a list of upcoming rides and they can pick the ones they want. Our goal is to show them the best rides for each driver first, so to that end we have an internal scoring system. In this exercise you will be implementing a slimmed down version of it

*Thank you for taking the time to work on this. We know that you are busy and we appreciate your effort.*



## A Note on Routing Services

At HopSkipDrive we use the Google Directions API for routing and traffic information. You can use that for this exercise if you want. An alternative is the open route service for which you can create a free account connected to your Github.

**Definitions:**
- The **driving distance** between two addresses is the distance in miles that it would take to drive a reasonably efficient route between them. It is not the straight line distance. It can be calculated by using a routing service
- The **driving duration** between two addresses is the amount of time in hours it would take to drive the driving distance under realistic driving conditions. It can be calculated by using a routing service
- The **commute distance** for a ride is the driving distance from the driverâ€™s home address to the start of the ride, in miles
- The **commute duration** for a ride is the amount of time it is expected to take to drive the commute distance, in hours.
- The **ride distance** for a ride is the driving distance from the start address of the ride to the destination address, in miles
- The **ride duration** for a ride is the amount of time it is expected to take to drive the ride distance, in hours
- The **ride earnings** is how much the driver earns by driving the ride. It takes into account both the amount of time the ride is expected to take and the distance. For the purposes of this exercise, it is calculated as: $12 + $1.50 per mile beyond 5 miles + **(ride duration)** * $0.70 per minute beyond 15 minutes


## Prompt: 
The primary goal of this exercise is for you to demonstrate how you think about testing, readability, and structuring a Rails application. We are also evaluating your ability to understand and implement requirements.

**Specification:**
- Create a Rails 7 application, using Ruby 3+
- Include the following entities:
    - Ride:
        - Has an id, a start address and a destination address. You may end up adding additional information
    - Driver:
        - Has an id and a home address
    - Build a RESTful API endpoint that returns a paginated JSON list of rides in descending score order for a given driver
        - Please write up API documentation for this endpoint in MarkDown or alternative
        - Calculate the score of a ride in $ per hour as: **(ride earnings) / (commute duration + ride duration)**. Higher is better
        - Google Maps is expensive. Consider how you can reduce duplicate API calls
    - Include RSpec tests


## Packaging
Please create a private github repo with your code and packaged assets and share it with @jacobkg
